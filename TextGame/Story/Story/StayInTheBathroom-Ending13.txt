You are unable to muster up the courage to leave, not right away, at least. Just a little longer, right? /You barricade yourself in as you tuck into the corner, the coast will be clear soon, right? The sky from the mildewy window goes from day to night, today, to night again. You will leave when they least expect it, right? Cobwebs form in your hair as you closely examine the space below the bathroom door. /They are still waiting for you out there, right? You shiver as your skin tightens, muscles atrophy, and your teeth start to fall out. It has not even been that long, right? Until the fateful day, you realize this is the perfect time, right? /You go to stand as your eyes rise to meet the door...before quickly descending to the ground once more. Your legs have been reduced to dust, and so has the rest of your body. The clothes on your back are nothing more than tatters and your vision starts to blur. As you disintegrate on the bathroom floor all you can think about is how you should have waited just a little bit longer, then you would have been home free, right?
