You try and defuse the situation. Carefully, you pick up the pan, holding it up not as a weapon but as a barrier of sorts, hoping that the presence of the pan will signal your intent not to cause harm. With a calm but firm voice, you attempt to communicate, trying to placate the creature and buy yourself some time to understand its intentions. “Oh, if you wanted to cook why didn’t you just say so?” croaks the monster. With a series of jerky movements, it gestures toward a cluttered counter now laden with an assortment of grotesque ingredients—bloodied meat, unidentifiable entrails, and a heap of moldy vegetables. It interprets your presence as an invitation to join in its macabre culinary endeavors. You cautiously begin to mimic its actions, stirring a pot filled with a repulsive mixture of congealed fluids and rancid scraps. As you stir, the creature watches intently, its grotesque smile widening with approval. You work alongside it, trying to keep your movements precise and steady, all the while suppressing your gag reflex. Despite the inedible nature of the ingredients, the creature seems genuinely pleased by your efforts, as if this bizarre, revolting meal is a testament to your newfound camaraderie. 

After the lengthy and unsettling cooking session, you and the creature finally sit down to share the meal. The food, a grotesque mix of inedible ingredients, looks as unappetizing as ever, but you force yourself to take a bite, hoping to appease your bizarre host. The moment the food touches your lips, a wave of dizziness washes over you. Your vision blurs, and before you can make sense of what is happening, you collapse onto the floor, the room spinning around you. 

When you come to, the dim light of the kitchen has been replaced by the warm, familiar glow of your grandmother’s living room. You blink in confusion, finding yourself sprawled in a cozy armchair, surrounded by the comforting sights, and sounds of home. The figure you had been so terrified of is now revealed to be your grandmother, her gentle face and warm smile reassuring you. She is busy preparing tea on the stove, her actions tender and familiar. 

 As you sit up and take in your surroundings, it all starts to make sense. The horrifying events were nothing more than a drunken hallucination. The creature in the kitchen, your grandmother, and the entire nightmarish scenario were all figments of your imagination brought on by too much alcohol. You breathe a sigh of relief as you realize that you are safe and sound at home.
