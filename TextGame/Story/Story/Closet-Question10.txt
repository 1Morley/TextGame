You open the door and find a closet. Jackets and coats are hung on a bar, some are long enough to drape over the things on the floor. Every part not taken by various junk is littered with black fur and small bones. In the very back of the closet, tucked behind a vacuum and various boxes, is what looks like a nest. As you look closer, you see eyes reflect your light followed by a low growl./

Gripping the can tightly, you logically decide you can investigate/ OR /offer the food inside, hoping it does not eat you instead.
