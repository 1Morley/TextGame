You enter the kitchen. The countertops surround half the room, sectioning off the kitchen from the dining room. The thing from the doorway is in here, moving from counter to counter. Starting on something before haphazardly dropping it and moving to something else. The counter is a mess with blood, dirty dishes, and various spilled ingredients. It does not seem to react to your presence. It seems to stay in its enclosed area. The dinner table is covered with plates of food. Some stacked on top of each other, broken ceramic, and spilled food litter the ground around it. Most of the food at the bottom is covered in a thick layer of mold, which stretches from plate to plate. There are two doors. One leads back into the main hallway, the other goes into the living room.
