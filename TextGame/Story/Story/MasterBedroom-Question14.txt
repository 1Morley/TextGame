You hurry up the stairs, your heart racing with each step. As you reach the top, you find yourself in a narrow, dimly lit hallway. The air is cold and musty, carrying the faint scent of mildew. To your left is the master bedroom, its door slightly ajar, revealing an inviting yet eerie stillness. To your right, the bathroom door stands closed, a faint light seeping through the cracks beneath it. 

Master bedroom or bathroom?
