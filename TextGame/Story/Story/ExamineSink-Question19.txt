You leave the candle in the sink. The counter is covered in yellow stains, especially around the faucet and drain. A small cup sits on the edge, holding a plastic toothbrush and toothpaste. On the other side of a small ceramic plate, holding a bar of soap. But it is at the stage where it is so thin it will fall apart in your hands if you attempt to use it. You look back up at the mirror. The grime that covers the mirror blurs your reflection. Which does not seem to move right, not moving coordinated with you but instead a moment behind. You feel as though this is the least weird thing you have seen all day and choose to ignore it. More importantly, the monsterâ€™s footsteps have receded, giving you a moment of brevity. 

/Should you leave the bathroom/ OR/ stay just a little bit longer?
