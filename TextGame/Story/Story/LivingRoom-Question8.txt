You enter the living room, where an ugly green couch with deep gouges cut into its arms dominates the space. A table with coffee stains sits nearby, and a mounted TV hangs above a fireplace covered in soot and charcoal. As you scan the room, your eyes land on a tin of cat food resting on the table. Instinctively, you pick it up, feeling a slight relief at finding something familiar.

With the tin in hand, you have two options: /you can either inspect the closet door on the left side of the room/ or /turn back and head upstairs to explore further.
