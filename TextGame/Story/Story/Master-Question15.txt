You open the door and lock yourself in the master bedroom. A large bed dominates the space, piled high with blankets and pillows in a mismatched array of colors and shapes. Next to the bed is a nightstand holding a lamp, a potted flower, a delicate music box, and other odd trinkets. Across from the bed stands an imposing wardrobe, big enough to hide inside if needed. At the foot of the bed, a desk catches your eye, its surface littered with bloodied tools and the remnants of something gory. The smell of iron lingers in the air, and you are left with unsettling choices before you. 

Lay on the bed OR examine the nightstand?
