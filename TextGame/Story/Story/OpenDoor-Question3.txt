You decide the house looks abandoned, so there is no point in knocking, right? With a bead of sweat trickling down your face, you grab the door handle and yank it open. The door swings violently, revealing that you have been watched since you arrived in this strange land by a figure already waiting for you. Without a second thought, you brush past the figure and dart into the dark house. The figure emits a horrific, ear-piercing shriek and begins to hobble after you. Though it is not extremely fast, you feel as if you are moving in slow motion, with no clear idea of where to go next./

Should you hide in the corner of the room/ OR /run towards a nearby stairwell?
