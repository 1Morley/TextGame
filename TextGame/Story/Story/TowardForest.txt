You get up and turn to the left toward the void. Your feet lead you faster and faster toward the unknown, almost as if they have a mind of their own. As you near the forest, the sunlight suddenly vanishes, and you glance back to see the door of the house swinging open in the wind. Turning back to the forest, a chill runs down your spine as your face turns paleâ€”it is over. Cold hands grip your soul, and you hear heavy breaths in your ear, followed by the last words you will ever hear before you are enveloped: "I made cookies... I hate when food gets wasted." 

Thank you for playing our game! Have a horrible day :P
