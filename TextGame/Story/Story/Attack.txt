As you hesitate at the kitchen's threshold, the monster’s erratic movements suddenly grow more violent. Its limbs twist and crack as it prepares to lunge. In a panic, you grab a heavy frying pan from the counter, your heartbeat pounding in your ears. With a desperate swing, you smash the pan against the creature’s head, again and again, as it lets out a chilling wail. The monster collapses to the floor, convulsing. Blood splatters across the room, and for a moment, silence fills the space. But as you stand over the crumpled form, gasping for breath, your vision clears. The grotesque figure at your feet shifts—no longer monstrous, but heartbreakingly familiar. It is your grandmother, lifeless and cold.
