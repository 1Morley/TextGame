As the melody from the music box plays, the monster's grotesque features begin to soften and melt away. /The sinister shadows recede, revealing a gentle figure beneath. /The room around you brightens, the decaying walls transforming into a cozy, familiar space. You realize, with a mixture of relief and disbelief, /that the terrifying creature before you was never a monsterâ€”it was your grandmother all along. The nightmare dissolves, and the house returns to the warmth and comfort of your childhood memories.
