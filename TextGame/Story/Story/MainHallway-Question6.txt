You are in a hallway. Several doors line the walls in addition to a staircase that goes upstairs. There is a small table next to the front door, on top are candles, a small bowl, and a statue. It looks like a shrine, but the statue does not look like anything you have seen before. The bowl holds small pieces of metal, beads, and wrapped candies. On the left side is a doorway into the living room, and a thin door closed door. A closet. At the end of the hallway seemed to be the kitchen. 

Examine the front door OR look at your surroundings?
