Upon closer inspection of the tarnished, yet delicately ornate key, you realize this must have gone to some mechanism as opposed to any ordinary door. It only takes one quick glance up at the nightstand to see a music box of similar appearance to realize they must go together. You insert the windup key inside the music box and hear a perfect clicking sound as it locks into place. However, as you do this, the monster claws at the master bedroom door, the hinges creaking as they stand on the edge of breaking. Hoping your years of watching scary movies have not let you down, you wind the music box, praying it will affect the approaching monster. 

/Do you want to wind it fast/ OR /slow?
