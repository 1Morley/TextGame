You begin to walk further into the kitchen. But the second your foot crosses the counter, the thing’s head twists to stare at you. A high pitched shrill coming from its mouth. You curl away from the noise; it is pissed now. The thing’s limbs pop and crack as it begins to move toward you. Reaching out to grab you. An unoccupied frying pan lays before you, should you handle this diplomatically, or will you just “handle this”? 

/Attack /or /wait?
