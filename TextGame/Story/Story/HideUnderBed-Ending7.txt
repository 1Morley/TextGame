This key can be solved another day, but as for right now, you decide to hide under the bed as the monster outside draws closer, hoping it will not find you. The room falls silent, and you think you are safe. But as you try to crawl out from beneath the bed, something cold and clammy grabs your leg. You strike a match, and in the dim light, you see a ghastly figure—a twisted parody of a human, its skin pale as death, eyes blacker than an abyss. “…Heart… I want… a heart…” it crackles, its voice dry and rasping. Your gaze falls on the gaping hole in its chest, a wound where a heart should be. Before you can react, it grabs your other leg. 

 “Your heart,” it whispers, pulling you into the void beneath the bed. The match flickers out, leaving you in darkness as you are dragged into the unknown.
